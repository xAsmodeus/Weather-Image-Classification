## 🔍 Overview

This program uses Python and the Tensorflow / Keras modules to classify Weather Images from a Kaggle dataset.

## 🏷️ Classes

The pictures are divided into 11 classes:

  1) dew
  
  2) fog/smog 
  
  3) frost 
  
  4) glaze
  
  5) hail 
  
  6) lightning
  
  7) rain
  
  8) rainbow 
  
  9) rime 
  
  10) sandstorm
  
  11) snow

## 🧠 Approach

There was a testing of parameters in the model(lr, different optimizers , dropout rates , pre-trained models and data-augmentation). The model was trained in 20 epochs, with a MobileNetV2/ResNet150V2 with early stopping for overfitting prevention. The results and the plots are being shown in the .ipynb file as well as the commentary.
